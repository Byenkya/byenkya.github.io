                    I found out that, the government of Uganda seeks to  undertake improvements in infrastructure such as good roads to link farm premises and markets, 
                    agro-product processing factories like maize millers factory in Kawanda and storage facilities to store large quantities of farm outputs like maize stores
                    and rice stores("Uganda: Community Agricultural Infrastructure Improvement Programme", 2006).
                    However, as the government tries to do all its best in improving the agricultural sector, 
                    farmers still have limited access to markets especially local markets which includes processes of identifying buyers of the farm outputs, 
                    finding prices as well as negotiating prices. This is due to lack of market information which inhibits the sale of their produce to the markets
                    hence lowering farmers and domestic income (Payne, 2002).
                    <b>
                        In response to the above problem, I proposed to design and implement a web service to help farmers realize greater sales of their agricultural produce
                        by enhancing communication between farmers and customers, thus improving on their income and increase the countryâ€™s GNP.
